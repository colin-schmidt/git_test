Practicing the following:
    - creating new files in the cmd line with touch or echo
    - editing those files the hacker way: code filename
    - staging that file in git with git add filename
    - checking the status of my git repo(?) with git status
    - unstaging that file with git restore --staged
    - committing that file with git commit
    - and adding a message to that commit with git commit -m "message text"
    - also forgetting to save the file in vs code before doing all of this lul
